        <dd>The phoenix is a mythical bird that symbolizes immortality, rebirth, and resurrection, and is associated with the sun. According to ancient Greek and Egyptian mythology, the phoenix is a bird that burns itself to death and is reborn from its own
            ashes. The phoenix is associated with renewal and rebirth, and is said to live for at least 500 years. When the phoenix is close to death, it builds a nest of spices and aromatic boughs, and then sets the nest on fire

        <dd>A vampire is a mythical creature that feeds on the life force of the living. In European folklore, vampires are undead beings that often visit loved ones and cause mischief or deaths in the neighborhoods they inhabited while they were alive. Vampires
            are fictional monsters that have been scapegoats for disease for hundreds of years. They have fangs, drink human blood, and can't see themselves in mirrors. They can be warded off with garlic, or killed with a stake through the heart

        <dt>werewolf</dt>

        <dd>In folklore, a werewolf, or lycanthrope, is a person who can change into a wolf, usually at night during a full moon. Some legends say that werewolves are people who can transform into wolves, while others say they are a combination of human and
            wolf. All werewolves are said to be bloodthirsty beasts that cannot control their desire to kill people and animals. In European folklore, werewolves are said to turn into wolves at night, eat people, animals, or corpses, and then return to
            human form during the day.
